# Centralized Relay
Centralized Relay serves as a trusted medium for message transfer between different chains.
The following chains are supported:
- ICON
- AVALANCHE

## Prerequisites

- **Go Language**: Version 1.21.0 or higher. Make sure to have Go properly installed and configured on your system. 
   For detailed installation instructions, please visit the [Go Installation Guide](https://go.dev/doc/install).

- **GNU Make**: This is an essential build automation tool used to compile and build the project from source files. 
   GNU Make streamlines the process of generating executables and other non-source components of the program. 
   To install GNU Make on your system, refer to the [GNU Make Official Website](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

- **Foundry**: Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.Please find the installation and usage guide [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

- **Geth(go-ethereum)**: It is the official Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol, enabling users to run a full Ethereum node. 
   It facilitates interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, executing transactions, and developing decentralized applications.
   Please visit the installation guide [here](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth).

- **Goloop CLI**: Goloop CLI is a command-line interface tool designed for managing nodes, executing transactions, deploying smart contracts, and interacting with the ICON blockchain network. Run the following command to install Goloop CLI.
   ```shell
   $ go install github.com/icon-project/goloop/cmd/goloop@latest
   ```
    More about Goloop can be found [here](https://docs.icon.community/concepts/computational-utilities/goloop).

## Relay installation and configuration
1. **Clone, checkout and install the latest release ([releases page](https://github.com/icon-project/centralised-relay/releases)).**

    ```shell
    $ git clone git@github.com:icon-project/centralised-relay.git
    $ cd centralised-relay
    $ make install
    ```
   Verify the installation and explore all the commands, sub commands and their usages.
    ```shell
   $ centralized-rly
    ```
2. **Wallet Creation**

   Centralized Relay necessitates the use of specific wallets in a JSON keystore file format for each chain to facilitate communication with their respective bridge(connection) contracts. 
   Use the following commands to create wallet for each chain:

   - For evm:
     ```shell
     $ geth account new --keystore <directory-for-keystore> --password <keystore-password>
     ```
   - For icon:
     ```shell
     $ goloop ks gen --out <directory-for-keystore> --password <keystore-password>
     ```
   Also make sure to load sufficient fake test balance in these wallets to perform operations like contract deployment and sending transactions.
   Balance can be loaded using faucets for each testnet. Look for the following faucets for specific testnet.
    - [Mumbai testnet faucet](https://mumbaifaucet.com/).
    - [Icon testnet faucet](https://faucet.iconosphere.io/).
   
   Next store these keystore files in a proper location. The wallet keystore file needs to be referenced in the chain configuration file. Follow next steps for chain configuration.

4. **Configure the chains you want to relay messages between.**

   Centralized Relay uses a configuration file to manage the settings for each chain. By default, it looks for the configuration at `$HOME/.centralized-relay/config.yaml`.
   Run the following command to create a configuration file at your preferred location specified by flag `--home`. If the path is not provided
   config file will be created in the default config path.
   ```shell
   $ centralized-rly config init --home $HOME/.centralized-relay
   ```
   **Adding Chain Configurations**:

   - To include a new chain, execute the command:
     ```shell
     centralized-rly chains add --config-path <your-config-path> --file <chain-config-file-path>
     ```
     - If `config-path` is not specified, the configuration will default to the standard path.
     - The `<chain-config-file-path>` should be the path to a JSON file containing the chain's metadata. The structure of this file can be modeled similar to the example found [here](/example/configs).

   **Listing Configured Chains**:
   - To view the list of configured chains, use the command:
     ```shell
     centralized-rly chains list
     ```
   - To view the config file, use the command:
      ```shell
     centralized-rly config show
     ```

   Ensure that each chain's configuration is accurately set up to facilitate smooth message relay between the specified networks.

5. **Run(start) the centralized relay**

   To start the Centralized Relay, use the following command:
   ```shell
   $ centralized-rly start --config-path <your-config-path> --db-path <your-db-path>
   ```
   - `db-path` refers to the path where the centralized-rly stores data(messages)
   that is relayed or to be relayed between chains. The default path is ```$HOME/.centralized-relay/data```
   
6. **Testing and Demo**
   
   Once the relay is up and running, you can test for relaying messages from one chain to another chain. For
   testing and demonstration, please refer [here]()
